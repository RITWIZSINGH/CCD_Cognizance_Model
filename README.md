## Introduction
In this project, a machine learning model is trained using PySpark's Logistic Regression. The goal is to predict the "Total Cloud Cover" using a set of input features. The provided code performs data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and prediction. The code is organized into different sections to achieve these tasks.

## Prerequisites
To run the code in this repository, you need to have the following installed:
- PySpark
- SparkSession
- Python

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/RITWIZSINGH/your-repo.git

2. Ensure you have PySpark and its dependencies installed.

3. Place your dataset file (`train.csv`) in the root directory of the repository.

4. Update the paths and filenames in the code as needed.

5. Execute the provided code step by step or as a whole to:
- Read and preprocess the data.
- Perform feature engineering using a VectorAssembler.
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Train a Logistic Regression model.
- Evaluate the model's performance.
- Make predictions on new data.

6. Optionally, place your new data file (`final test.csv`) in the root directory and update the filename in the code. Run the appropriate sections of the code to make predictions on the new data.
